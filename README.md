## Toxicity inspector (Undergraduate project - Spring 2022)
 This project introduces a web-based application (Toxicity Inspector) to serve as an 
evaluation platform that enables the online store's owners or the researcher of toxicity to inspect the overall 
validity of the toxicity level for given comments. 
- Additionally, it will allow them to provide their feedback on the obtained results.
